			<div class="content">Pansy. Kids have names? Why would a robot need to drink? Guess again. This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!<br><br>

				I don't want to be rescued. Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!<br><br>

				I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. Is the Space Pope reptilian!? You're going to do his laundry? Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.</div>

			<div class="content">My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. Is that a cooking show?<br><br>
				What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.

			<div class="line content">Belligerent and numerous. And when we woke up, we had these bodies. It's toe-tappingly tragic! And I'm his friend Jesus. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial?
				<div class="line_quote">Marco Polo, The silk road</div>

			<div class="content">You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?!<br><br>

				No. We're on the top. Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…<br><br>

				You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? With gusto. You can see how I lived before I met you. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!<br><br>

				Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.</div>
